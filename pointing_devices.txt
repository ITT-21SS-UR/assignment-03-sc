a) Which advantages do direct pointing devices have over indirect pointing devices? 
   Name one use case where using a direct pointing device would not make any sense.

With a direct pointing device, you know immediately which position you have selected;
with an indirect pointing device, you must first find the position of the cursor 
on the screen.

With a direct pointing device, the movement is transmitted directly to the device, 
so that the cursor moves on the screen in the same way as the finger. 
Another advantage of a direct pointing device is that you do not need an 
additional device, such as a mouse or joystick, usually the device is already 
equipped with a touchscreen or the like. In contrast, with an indirect pointing 
device, the movement of the mouse is translated and transferred to the cursor 
on the screen. This can lead to latencies. 
    
One use case where direct pointing is not practical would be, 
when you want to control a very large screen that is difficult to reach 
(e.g. for a presentation with a live demo). Here it would be very exhausting and 
impractical to directly select an element on the screen. An indirect device would 
be more suitable in this situation.

b) How would you characterize “Shift” based on the classification criteria 
   mentioned in the Wikipedia article?

Shift is a direct input device where you can directly manipulate the postion of 
the cursor with your finger. The on-screen pointer is in the same physical position 
as the pointing device (e. g. finger or  stylus on a touch screen)). 
According to Wikipedia Shift adheres to the absolute movement classfication 
category.
Shift uses position control. The postion of the on-screen pointer is directly changed 
instead of converting the speed or something like that into a cursor movement. 
It is an isometric device because the pressure is measured. Shift has two or three 
degrees of freedom: The x and y position and optionally the pressure.

The possible states are "out of range", "dragging", "tracking" and "zooming" in 
order to reach smaller object more easily.

c) What is the size of the display used in the study?

For the study the IPAQ PDA with a size of 550 x 730mm and 240 × 320px was used.
The effective resolution of the display was 0.436px/mm.
