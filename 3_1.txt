What does Hornbæk say about the relationship between self-reported and
objectively measured task performance?

The subjective perception of the results by the users does not 
correlate with the actual measured objective results.

Hassenzahl argues that subjective and objective qualities are very different. 
Experience is subjective and arises from situations, objects, people, and the 
relationships between components, but it arises and remains in the mind. It 
does not matter how objective a product is, its quality must also be 
experienced in order to cause an effect.

###
Task performance is also strongly influenced by the participant's level 
of understanding of the task. If a participant does not understand the 
task, it will affect the performance and the results will be of less 
value to the researcher.

Describe advantages and limitations of research hypotheses.

Several advantages are described in the paper:
- Hypotheses can help you gain clarity about what you are working on and they can 
  be useful in focusing on the research questions.
- They can help you to summarize previous work and use these in motivating and 
  planning your own experiment. 
- Hypotheses can also serve as support for the report of your experiment.
- Furthermore they are bound to theory.

Mentioned drawbacks / limitations of hypotheses are:
- Being fixated to one hypothesis can lead to overlooking other interesting 
  aspects, so be open-minded or use multiple theories to analyse the data.
- Greenwald argued that too often the null hypothesis of an experiment is 
  formulated only to be disconfirmed, as only that seems to be an acceptable 
  valuable result. For HCI experiments, the recommendation is to perform powerful 
  comparisons that may also fail, and where failure can teach us something valuable.
- Researchers tend to change experimental design rather than revise theory when 
  faced with contradictory evidence.

Is it acceptable to conduct user studies with media informatics students as 
participants instead of a broad sample of potential users? 

Yes, it is acceptable because student participation in a study does not matter itself.  

###
What are advantages and limitations?

Advantages of using students as participants include that they are easy and inexpensive
to recruit, have strong cognitive skills, and are accustomed to an authoritarian work style.

However, it is important to note that you should check if the students are representative
for the study if you want to generalize it. In fact, this is a limit that students are 
not necessarily representative for a generalization to the whole population.
At best, a study should consider different age, occupational, and social groups.

###
Name one topic for a user study where it would be problematic to have only
media informatics students as participants. 

For example, if you want to evaluate a Corona app, it would not make sense to include 
only media informatics students in a study, as they are very tech-savvy and therefore 
do not represent the general population.


###
Name one counter-example. 

If you want to explore how novice programmers cope with certain programming tasks and 
how to support them in their learning process, mediaiformatics students are quite 
suitable to be study participants.
