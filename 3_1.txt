What does Hornbæk say about the relationship between self-reported and
objectively measured task performance?

Hornbæk found out that the users perception of outcomes did not correlate with 
actual measured outcomes.
The participants understanding of the task is relevant to the task performance 
because if a participant can't understand the task, his/her performance is 
probably going to be a lot different and to be of little value to the 
researcher.

p. 35
Some researchers maintain that understanding tasks implies being aware of the 
criteria for evaluating performance. 

Hassenzahl argued that subjective and objective qualities are 
fundamentally different:

    Experience is subjective. It emerges through situations, objects, people, 
    their interrelationships, and their relationship to the experientor, but it 
    is created and remains in her or his head...

Describe advantages and limitations of research hypotheses.

Several advantages are described in the paper:
- Hypotheses can help you gain clarity about what you are doing and might help 
  you focus on research questions.
- They can help you to summarize and think about earlier work or can help you 
  to design and motivate your own experiment. 
- Hypotheses can also serve as support for the report of your experiment. 
- Furthermore they are bound to theory.

Mentioned drawbacks / limitations of hypotheses are:
- that a strong argument against the usage of hypotheses is that the reliance 
  on theory may blind you to interesting findings. 
- Greenwald argued that too often the null hypothesis of an experiment is 
  formulated only to be disconfirmed.
- Greenwald et al. [52] argued that researchers who depend heavily on theory 
  are more likely to revise experiments (e.g., change procedures, predictions, 
  or analysis of data) if finding disconfirming evidence rather than to revise 
  theory.

Is it acceptable to conduct user studies with media informatics students as 
participants instead of a broad sample of potential users? 

In several cases it is acceptable to conduct user studies with them because 
often they are the only available participants that can be easiliy 
recruited (for our course study) especially because of Corona.
TODO reasons.

###
What are advantages and limitations? 

Another advantage is that ... TODO

Limitations are that they are not represantative enough.
Usually different kinds of study or backgrounds of people should be considered.

###
Name one topic for a user study where it would be problematic to have only
media informatics students as participants. 

E. g. if you want to check how adapted/comfortable students are with their PC (Computer Affinität) 
the media informatic students would have a higher affinity with those devices
therefore different backgrounds and characteristics should be considered.

###
Name one counter-example. 

If you want to research how programming beginners cope with certain programming 
tasks and read code in comparision to more advanved programmers in the same 
course of study in higher semester or BA versus MA students.
