What does Hornbæk say about the relationship between self-reported and objectively measured task performance?

Hornbæk found out that the users perception of outcomes did not correlate with actual measured outcomes.

Deciding between these approaches is hard. On the one hand, repre-
sentative tasks may contain irrelevant elements and may lead to greater
variation in performance; hypotheses may also concern only a part of
such tasks. On the other hand, using simple tasks requires an argu-
mentation for why they are relevant for real work (for instance like
the one by Dragicevic et al. quoted above). O
 S. 35
 Finally, participants’ understanding of tasks and their involvement
in the experimental situation are important to all studies. 
If participants do not understand the task, their performance is likely to vary
a lot and to be of little value to the experimenter. 
Some researchers
maintain that understanding tasks implies being aware of the criteria
for evaluating performance. In many studies on pointing, for instance,
this has lead to researchers to instruct participants to “work as fast
as possible while still maintaining high accuracy” [31, p. 217]. Others
maintain that experimental realism — the extent to which participants
experience the experiment as meaningful and involving — is key to
useful insights. Experimenters can try to achieve the above by pilot
testing, careful debriefings that elicit participants’ view of the experi-
ments, clear instructions, and intrinsically motivating tasks.

 Hassenzahl [59, p. 9] argued that subjective and
objective qualities are fundamentally different:

    Experience is subjective. It emerges through situations, objects, people, their interrelationships, and their
    relationship to the experientor, but it is created and remains in her or his head. Given that, it may be not
One way to use these results is to assume that dimensions of the usabil-
ity construct are relatively independent and to collect measures on all
dimensions

Describe advantages and limitations of research hypotheses.

Several advantages are described in the paper:
- Hypotheses can help you gain clarity about what you are doing and might help you focus on research questions.
- They can help you to summarize and think about earlier work or can help you to design and motivate your own experiment. 
- Hypotheses can also serve as support for the report of your experiment. 
- Furthermore they are bound to theory.

Mentioned drawbacks / limitations of hypotheses are:
- that a strong argument against the usage of hypotheses is that the reliance on theory may blind you to interesting findings. 
- Greenwald argued that too often the null hypothesis of an experiment is formulated only to be disconfirmed
- Greenwald et al. [52] argued that researchers who depend heavily on theory are more likely to revise experiments (e.g., change procedures, predictions, or analysis of data) if finding disconfirming evidence rather than to revise theory.

Is it acceptable to conduct user studies with media informatics students as participants instead of a broad sample of potential
users? 

In several cases it is acceptable to conduct user studies with them because often they are the only available participants that can be more easiliy recruited especially because of Corona.


##
What are advantages and limitations? 

Not represantative enough; different kinds of study or backgrounds of people are not considered

##
Name one topic for a user study where it would be problematic to have only
media informatics students as participants. 
E. g. if you want to check how adapted/comfortable students are with their PC (Computer Affinität) 
The media informatic students would have a higher affinity with those devices.

##
Name one counter-example. 
If you want to research how programming beginners cope with certain programming tasks and read code in comparision to more advanved programmers in the same course of study in higher semester or BA versus MA students.
