In the first condition no wrong reactions were observed
but in the second condition the space bar was pressed three times
when a false number was displayed.
Each participant made exactly one mistake in the whole study.
It should be noted that one person participated twice in the study.

Also nobody pressed an incorrect key.

Further, the second run took a bit longer due to the randomly chosen 
numbers which caused the participants to be somewhat impatient.
The longer duration might lead to fatigue effects so it can not be
excluded that this influences the reaction time.
It was observed that 2 out of 3 participants made the mistake
in the second run which could contribute to this effect.
