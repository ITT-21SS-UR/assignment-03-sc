With the first condition no mistaken inputs where observed, 
but with the second condition three times the space bar was pressed 
when the false number was displayed.

Further, the second run took a bit longer due to the randomly chosen 
numbers, which caused the participants to be somewhat impatient.
The longer duration might lead to fatigue effects, so it can not be 
excluded that this influences the reaction time.
